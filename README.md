- Hello, my name is Carlos Vazquez
- This page is meant to store and showcase various projects that I've worked on over the years
- I'm mainly interested in computer science, data science, and computational biology. My main programming languages are Python, R, and Java, but I'm currently learning a few more.
- At the moment, I'm pursuing a degree in computational biology at the University of Texas at Austin, with an added Computer Science Certificate.
